# Quadcop-Project
Quadcopter with an android phone that recognizes criminals and gives GPS coordinates while in hot pursuit.
There are multiple C++ and Python programs in this repo that accomplish this task. The codes are relatively simple to understand, but requires prerequisites in ROS and OpenCV. 
Just add the src and scripts folder to your ROS package. Compare your Cmakelists and package.xml to make the appropriate changes. 

7_Display.py initiates the GUI that was developed for the view the Quadcopter's attitude, and the video feed from the Android phone. Connect a gaming joystick before running this program.
