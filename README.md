# Quadcop-Project
Quadcopter with an android phone that recognizes criminals and gives GPS coordinates while in hot pursuit.
There are multiple C++ and Python programs in this repo that accomplish this task. The codes are relatively simple to understand, but requires prerequisites in ROS and OpenCV.
